We examine a "generalized topological sigma model," the M-Theoretic analog of the standard topological sigma model of string theory. The observables are elements in the cohomology ring of the moduli space of supersymmetric maps; the correlation functions allow us to compute non-perturbative corrections to the four-fermion terms in M-Theory on a six-dimensional Calabi–Yau.
