This set of lecture notes presents a pedantic derivation of the connection between the Â-genus of spacetime's loop space and the genus one partition function of the N=1/2 sigma model. It concludes with remarks on possible generalizations of the Â-genus that follow from the stringy point of view but have yet to be explored mathematically. Geared towards a mathematical audience unfamiliar with the N=1/2 sigma model.
