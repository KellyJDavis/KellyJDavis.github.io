Presents the GridLab software architecture, consisting of GAT (Grid Application Toolkit), environment-specific adaptors, and GridLab services. Elaborates on the concepts underlying GAT and outlines the corresponding API. Presents the functionality of GridLab's high-level services and demonstrates how a dynamic grid application can easily benefit from GAT.
