We examine the compatibility of results relating M-Theory to String Theory with the string-string duality conjecture in six dimensions. We re-derive the relation between M-Theory and Type IIA strings, then examine in detail M-Theory on K3×S¹ and its relation to the Heterotic theory on T⁴, with remarks on M-Theory on T⁴×(S¹/Z₂) and Type II on K3.
