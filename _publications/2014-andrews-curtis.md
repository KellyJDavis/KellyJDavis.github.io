The Andrews–Curtis conjecture—that every balanced presentation of the trivial group can be transformed into the trivial presentation by a sequence of Andrews–Curtis moves—is unresolved. Michael Freedman has shown that some counterexamples would refute the smooth four-dimensional Poincaré conjecture. We construct a parallel algorithm that searches for counterexamples, run it on the Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud, and report the results.
