This article examines the various hints which suggest an Alcubierre type warp drive can be constructed under the assumption that the physics of this world is described by M-Theory. It reviews the relevant physics—superstring theory and M-Theory—and examines the physical states of M-Theory that suggest an Alcubierre type warp drive may be possible within that framework.
